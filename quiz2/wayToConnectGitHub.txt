To make it work, I needed three new packages installed and loaded.  You might already have them.

install.packages("httr")
library(httr)
install.packages("httpuv")
library(httpuv)
install.packages("jsonlite")
library(jsonlite)


 To learn a bit more about what is going on I used R help on each of the commands.

help(oauth_endpoints)
help(oauth_app)
help(oauth2.0_token)
help(stop_for_status)
help(content)

Then I ran step 1, though I'm not sure this is necessary .

oauth_endpoints("github")


Next I went to GitHub to Register RStudio to it
https://github.com/settings/applications

Application Name  :  I used      RStudio    ( but I don't think it matters what you put here)
Homepage Url        :                https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos
Application description :          coursera coursework    (doesn't matter)
Authorization Callback Url:      http://localhost:1410

Click on Update Application.
You should see    Client ID    and a 20-digit hex number
                             Client Secret    and a very long hex number
You will need these.

Back to RStudio,
put your Client ID and Client Secret hex numbers in the oauth_app  command, and run it.

myapp <- oauth_app("github", "your-20-digits", secret="your-very-long-hex-number")


Then run step 3

github_token <- oauth2.0_token(oauth_endpoints("github"), myapp)


At this point I discovered I needed httpuv, and R asked me whether I wanted to save the authorizations to a file .  I said 1. (for yes).


Next run step 4, the GET, but with the jtleek/repos  file

req <- GET("https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos", config(token = github_token))

This gets the JSON structure and data into a variable called req.
